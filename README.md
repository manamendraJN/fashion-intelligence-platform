👗 AI-Driven Fashion Recommendation System
📖 Project Overview

This project is an intelligent, AI-driven fashion recommendation platform designed to deliver personalized, context-aware, and time-adaptive styling suggestions. Unlike traditional fashion recommendation systems that treat user preferences as static, this system captures how personal style evolves over time, considering factors such as seasons, lifestyle changes, occasions, body measurements, and grooming needs.

The system integrates multiple AI modules—including wardrobe learning, body measurement extraction, accessories recommendation, and grooming analysis—to provide a complete and holistic fashion assistance experience. The solution promotes sustainable fashion, reduces decision fatigue, and improves user confidence in styling and purchase decisions.
